The Naives Bayes Sex Classifier is based on the Bayesian Theorem. The classifier will make a guess about the gender of a person. Given attributes (height, weight) inputted by the user, the classifier uses Bayesian Theorem and the current training data in the database to come to a conclusion about the gender.
